# Broken Image Error in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML: using an `<img>` tag with a missing or incorrect `src` attribute. This results in a broken image, potentially affecting the visual presentation of your webpage.

The `bug.html` file shows the error. The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code.

## Error Description:

The error occurs when an image source is not found or incorrectly specified in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag. This often leads to a blank space or a broken image icon instead of the expected image.

## Solution:

Ensure that the `src` attribute correctly points to the actual image file. Verify the file path, filename, and extension. Double-check that the image file exists in the specified location and is accessible.
